**Automated icon generation using Figma's API.**

</div>

This script pulls all components from a Figma file, loops through them and generates the required exports. For mobile we automatically create the @1x, @2x and @3x versions.

---

### Todo ⚠️

- [ ] Investigate web hooks so when a new version of the library is published we kick off a deployment
- [ ] Create a `meta.json` file that keeps track of all images and names. We'll use this to determine the version bumps of the package. If an image has been removed or renamed then its a major, if one has been added or modified it's a minor.

---

## Usage

### Install the package

`yarn add @fairfx/geometry-icons`

### Import images

**Web**

```tsx
import { web } from "@fairfx/geometry-icons";

const { IconTransaction } = web;

const MyComp = () => <IconTransaction />;
```

**Mobile**

```tsx
import { native } from "@fairfx/geometry-icons";

const MyComp = () => <Image source={native.transaction} />;
```

## Development

1. Add a `.env` to the root of the project and add the following:

```
PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token-from-figma>

```

2. Run `yarn install`
