## Additional configuration

### Commitlint - conventional commit scopes

If you are using `wc-config` in a single package repository and intend on using `commitlint` and `commitizen` to enforce conventional commits for commit messages, you will need to define the conventional commit scopes to utilise. Create a `wc.config.js` file in the root of your repository with content in the format shown below:

```js
module.exports = {
  scopes: ['scope-a', 'scope-b', 'and-another-scope'],
};
```
