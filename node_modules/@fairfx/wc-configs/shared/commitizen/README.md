## Usage

Installing `@fairfx/wc-configs` provides access to the Commitizen CLI, as well as the Commitlint prompt CLI that it utilises as an adapter.
The installation also exposes a script in `./node_modules/.bin` called `wc-commitizen`, and this is the script to be used when commiting to the repo.

For more info on how Commitizen CLI works please read the documentation [here](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).

### From command line

Execute the following:

```
./node_modules/.bin/wc-commitizen
```

### As a `package.json` script

Add the following to your `package.json` file:

```
{
  ...,
  "scripts": {
    "commit": "wc-commitizen"
  },
  ...
}
```
