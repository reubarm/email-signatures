## Package Structure

Configurations are separated under three different folders based on which platforms they are compatible with:

- [Web](web/README.md)
- [Mobile](mobile/README.md)
- [Shared](shared/README.md)

To not break past integrations before this structure change, configuration directories that used to exist at the root level of this module have been symlinked back to root from their new locations.
