## Usage

`tsconfig.json` allows extensions via the `extends` key, but doesn't support module resolution (i.e. a node module), thus making it quite restrictive when it comes to referencing the path to a parent config file. Paths specified must be relative or absolute, absolute paths being of no use to us in the context of a shared code base.

Importing the shared config from `./node_modules/@fairfx/wc-configs/mobile' is our only option.

To import this configuration you need to create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your repo and add:

```json
{
  "extends": "./node_modules/@fairfx/wc-configs/mobile/tsconfig/tsconfig.json"
  // Your overrides here
}
```

## Development

If you want to modify the tsconfig, please make sure you take a look at the [documentation for tsconfig](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) before you do so.
